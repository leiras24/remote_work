# Remote Work Health Analysis
The objective of this work is to demonstrate how many aspect in our working life can have an impact on the health of workers. Using the dataset taken of Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratyushpuri/remote-work-health-impact-survey-2025), my job was to clean and manipulate the data in a way where I could make an approach to what were the factors that can impact the health of workers. 
In this step, using BigQuery, I created a risk score, in which it creates a score to check the well-being of workers and how much of them have a balance and healthy life-style or if the work they are currently is too much for them to be healthy. 

# Documents

- a sql file, where you can check the code that I used to clean and manipulate the data
