# Remote Work Health Analysis
This project explores how different aspects of remote work influence the mental and physical health of employees. Using the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratyushpuri/remote-work-health-impact-survey-2025), the goal was to identify which work-related factors contribute the most to remote workers’ well-being or stress levels.

To do this, the dataset was cleaned and transformed using BigQuery, where a Risk Score was created to assess the overall well-being of remote workers. This score aggregates multiple variables (such as hours worked, burnout, mental health status, and social isolation) to categorize individuals as Healthy, At Risk, Unhealthy, or Very Unhealthy.

After processing the data, the results were exported to CSV and analyzed through an interactive Power BI dashboard, which visualizes how each factor contributes to worker health.

# Documents
In this project, you can find:
- SQL file: Data cleaning, transformation, and risk score calculation using BigQuery
- CSV file: Cleaned dataset ready for analysis

# Objective
To understand the primary factors affecting the health of remote workers and determine whether specific job conditions—especially in remote settings—may contribute to higher stress or health risks.
